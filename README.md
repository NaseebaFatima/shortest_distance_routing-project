The Route Planner Application is a sophisticated full-stack web solution designed to calculate the most efficient driving route between two specified locations.
Utilizing OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API for geocoding and the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) for route calculation.
The application provides precise measurements of distance and travel duration.
For calculating the distance between coordinates, the application employs the Haversine formula, which accounts for the Earth's spherical shape to deliver accurate distance measurements.
